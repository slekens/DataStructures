# DataStructures

Data structure collection to have aditional structures to the Swift standar libraries. This Package contains the next data structures:

## 1. Queue

    - QueueArray
    - QueueLinkedList
    - QueueRingBuffer

## 2. Stack

    The **Stack** data structure is identical, in concept, to a physical stack of objects. When you add an item to a stack, you place ir on top of the stack. When you remove an item from stack, you always remove the top-most item.
    There are only two essential operations for a stack:
    - push: Adding an element to the top of the stack.
    - pop: Removing the top element of the stack.
    Non essential operations that make a stack easier to use:
    - peek: Look at the top of the element.
    - isEmpty: Check if the stack is empty.
    **Key points**

## 3. LinkedList

    - DoubleLinkedList

## 4. RingBuffer
